## Overveiw
**Mitron Bank**, a prestigious legacy financial institution based in **Hyderabad**, is poised to expand its product portfolio by introducing an **innovative line of Payment cards**. As part of this strategic initiative, we aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of **customer spending behaviors** to inform the development of these new financial products.

### Key Objectives:
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identifying which customer segments exhibit the **highest spending levels**, allowing for tailored marketing strategies and product features.
- **Spending Categories**: Analyzing the categories where customers allocate their expenses the most, whether it be **travel**, **dining**, **retail**, or other areas, to enhance card offerings with relevant rewards and benefits.
- **Payment Methods**: Evaluating the most popular payment methods utilized by customers, which will inform our decision on the features and functionalities of the new credit cards.

By understanding these dynamics, Mitron Bank will be well-equipped to introduce a payment card product line that not only meets the diverse needs of its customers but also positions the bank competitively in the financial market. This initiative aims to foster **customer loyalty**, increase **market share**, and enhance overall **satisfaction** with our banking services.
